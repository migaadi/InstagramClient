# InstagramClient

This is an Android demo application for displaying Instagram popular pictures using Instagram Endpoint media/popular APIs.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

* [x] Required: User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
* [x] Required: For each photo displayed, user can see the following details: # Graphic, Caption, Username
* [x] Optional: Like count

Notes:

Wasn't able to make the username in bold style when using same TextView for both username and caption. Tried to use HTML but not sure if the usage is correct.
